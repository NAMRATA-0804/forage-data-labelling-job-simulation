## Personal Reflection

This job simulation gave me my first hands-on exposure to how AI systems are trained using labeled data.

I learned that accurate intent, sentiment, and PII labeling is critical for building reliable and ethical machine learning models.

I especially enjoyed reviewing ambiguous cases, where careful judgment and consistency were required.

This experience increased my interest in data operations, AI support, and trust & safety roles.
